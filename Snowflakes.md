Now read this and read this carefully, people nowadays think it's *cool* to play the victim. Everything bad is always because of someone else, nothing
is ever *my* fault. do you think you know struggle? Have you ever been in a fight over your life? Have you cried tears of joy for a single piece of corn lodged deep into the enemy latreen? You don't know struggle, you don't know tough. all these modern musicians, they all want be the next Van Halen but none of them want to PRACTICE!!! Wake up buttercup, life aint fair!
